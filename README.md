Project Name: Intro to Programming Week 1 Code Review
Description: This is our week 1 code review for intro to programming. We were tasked to make a site that displays our new coding skills and tells the reader a little about ourselves. I used HTML and CSS to create this page with links to Javascript plugins.
Program setup instructions: Clone this repository to your terminal. Open with a program that can edit HTML such as Atom.
